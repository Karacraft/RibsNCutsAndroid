# RibsNCuts-Android
### Ribsncuts Android Application for customers

and keep it in sqlite database for offline reading. Use can view and select the items which can then be
added to the offline cart. When user wants to order, he/she must go online in order for application to 
place the order. User Login via Social Media accounts or Ribsncuts Login is required for succesfull
order placement.
